            ref={bridPlayerRef3}
            style={styles.square}
            bridPlayerConfig={{
              playerReference: 'player_3', // Player reference important for Events
              playerID: xxxx, // PlayerID from BridTV cms
              mediaID: xxxxxxxx, //VideoID or PlaylistID from BridTv cms

              controlAutoplay: false, //enables the client to take control over autoplay
              scrollOnAd: true, //This option enables scrolling during ad and is specific to the iOS platform. By default, Android has scrolling enabled during ads.
              creditsLabelColor: '614BC3', // To achieve color modification for credits label, it is necessary to provide a sequence of six hexadecimal characters, excluding the '#' symbol.
              setCornerRadius: 30, //This property enables setting the corner radius to the player itself. Its value is in pixels.
              localization: 'en', //This property allows selecting the language in which the player and IMA will operate.
              doubleTapSeek: 10, // This property set seek seconds for double tap seek player UI.
              seekPreview: 1 // When set to 1, the feature is enabled and will be visible in all operational modes of the player. When set to 2 the thumbnail image preview during seeking will be available exclusively when the player is in fullscreen mode.


            }}
            //Callback for Events from all players in one Activity {"message": "video/ad event", "playerReference": "reverence to player from props"}
            handleAllPlayerEvents={(eventData) =>handleAllPlayerEvents(eventData)}
            //Video
            handleVideoLoad={(eventData) => handleVideoLoad(eventData)}
            handleVideoStart={(eventData) => handleVideoStart(eventData)}
            //Error
            handleVideoError={(eventData) => handleVideoError(eventData)}
          />

```

It includes properties playerID, mediaID, typeOfPlayer, useVPAIDSupport,      playerReference, controlAutoplay, scrollOnAd, creditsLabelColor, setCornerRadius, localization. Explanations for each of the properties are given in the section above.

    -  handleVideoSeek, 
    -  handleFullscreenOpen, 
    -  handleFullscreenClose,
    -  handleVideoAutoplay
      //Pip events
    -  handlePlayerEnterPip?: () => void;
    -  handlePlayerExitPip?: () => void;

+ **handleVideoError**: A callback function that handles video errors. It receives an errorEvent object. These are the error event types that can occur with the BridPlayer:

    - **adError**:
        - Name: adError
        - Message: Error occurred during ad playback.
        - Code: 300

        - Code: 102

    - **protectedContent**:
        - Name: playerProtectedContent

        - Code: 103

    - **lostIntenetConnection**:
        - Name: playerLostInternetConnection
